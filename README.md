## Hi there ☀️ I'm Karen!

My name is Karen Choi and I'm a former auditor turned software engineer. Before attending the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, I spent 8 months self-studying and building various projects (thanks to The Odin Project and teachers on YouTube!) everyday after work. Now as part of the immersive software engineering program, I am learning more than ever and excited to start working again in the tech industry! 🥳
